# 5-Essentials

This program scrapes data from the 5 Essentials website into csv form. It gathers data for all measures across all available schools in the 2018 public report. A school profile information report from the Chicago Open Data portal is used to determine the list of school ID's that are active in the 2018-2019 school year. Report year and selected schools may be adjusted as necessary.

Averages are currently only available for all survey respondents in a school. Future updates may make the full breadth of student subgroups available.
